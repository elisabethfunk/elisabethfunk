        <a name="about"></a><h2>about elisabeth</h2>
        <p>I have a habit of stringing words together. I add magic to everything I write. (Literally. I can't make it one single chapter without inserting at least one potion or spell.) I'm excited by and anxious about technology all the same. I have strong opinions about religion and gods and What Life Means. I'm terrified of the apocalypse. Don't @ me with your Yellowstone theories.</p>
        <p><strong>The Golden Compass</strong> shaped me. <strong>Harry Potter</strong> stole my soul and <strong>Dragon Age</strong>'s Alistair kidnapped my heart. (What do you mean, I can't make every love interest a rogueish goof?) <strong>Stardew Valley</strong> made me forget about sunlight. I'd cross a kingdom for <strong>Kaz Brekker</strong>. I've watched <strong>Moulin Rouge</strong> at least 25 times. I am 50% <strong>Mia Thermopolis</strong>.</p>
        <p>I live in Denver, Colorado, with a man I bought on the internet, a good doggo who thinks every day is the best day for tug-of-war (especially when it's snowing), and two cats. One is my best friend and the other silently judges us all.</p>
        <p>In my <a href="http://wiebe.co">other life</a> I'm a freelance writer and desk jockey, depending on the day.</p>
        <p>My pen name honors my middle name (my favorite name) and my late grandmother, who was the <a href="http://kfwiebe.blogspot.com/">best feminist Mennonite writer</a> (phew, that's a mouthful, but it's all true) on the planet.</p>

        <p><strong>Of Souls and Saviours</strong> is about magic, god, growing up, and kissing. It's about ghosts, literal and metaphorical. It's about best friends and losing them and finding them again in unexpected places. It's also about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Memory-restoring potions</li>
            <li>Radios tuned to the frequency of the dead</li>
            <li>Schools built in graveyards</li>
            <li>Missing singers</li>
            <li>Frontier medicine shows</li>
            <li>Glass-bottomed boats</li>
            <li>Fancy costumes</li>
            <li>Losing religion</li>
            <li>First hangovers and first heartbreaks.</li>
        </ul>
